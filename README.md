# 📘 Novel Progress Tracker

_A lightweight Obsidian plugin designed for novelists to track writing progress across multiple chapters or projects._

---

## ✨ Overview

📘 Novel Progress Tracker is a plugin for novel writers using Obsidian.  
It helps you monitor your writing progress in real-time with word counts, progress bars, and project-level statistics — all while keeping your text in clean Markdown.

This plugin is especially useful when writing for contests with strict word count limits.

## 🧩 Key Features

- 📊 **Real-time word count per note**
- 📈 **Progress bars** based on project-specific word count goals
- 📁 **Multi-chapter project support**
  - Each chapter can be a separate Markdown file
- 📅 **Deadline tracking** (optional)
- 🔢 **Percentage display** against goal
- 📘 **Contest-aware settings**
  - Set maximum word count per project (e.g. 40,000 characters for a contest)
- 📱 **iCloud support** for cross-platform writing (Windows/iOS)
- 🗂️ **Supports multiple projects**
  - Switch between novel projects easily

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Create a folder for each novel project.
2. Assign a word count goal and (optionally) a deadline via `project.json` or settings.
3. Write each chapter in its own `.md` file.
4. The plugin automatically calculates:
   - Total word count of the project
   - Percentage complete
   - Visual progress bar
5. All stats update live as you write.
